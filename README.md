# Project-4-Game-Show-App
This app involves a word game that the player interacts with until they win or loose

Add CSS to hide the message hidden in the letter place holders. If you highlight over them you can cheat and get the message. 
I used .hide under the keyboard section-Removing the copy over center/from the page 

.hide{
  text-indent: -11111px;
}
adding the negative removes, without it the site creates a horizontal scroll function b/c the indent is added to rather than removed.
